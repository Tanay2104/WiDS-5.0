### **Week 1: The Toolbox - Python & NumPy Fundamentals**

**Objective:** By the end of this week, you will be comfortable with the basics of the Python language and the NumPy library. You will be able to write vectorized code to perform fast numerical operations and create simple visualizations.

#### **Part 1: Learning Resources**

This is mainly for those new to Python and Numpy. For those who are familiar, you may directly skip to the assignment, since it will be used later. Your goal this week is to go through these high-quality tutorials. You don't need to memorize everything, but focus on understanding the core concepts. We'll also provide a tutorial on git, which will be (forever) useful for version control.

*   **Python Basics (for those: new to the language):**
    * **Tutorial:** ([FreeCodeCamp Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc))
    *   **Reference:** The Official Python Tutorial ([docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html))

    *   **Focus on:** Get comfortable with basic syntax. Focus especially on the later parts such as Object Oriented Programming in Python.
    
*   **NumPy - The Core of Scientific Computing:**
    * **Tutorial** ([FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI&pp=ygUgbnVtcHkgdHV0b3JpYWwgZm9yIGJlZ2lubmVycyBmY2M%3D))
    *   **Resource:** NumPy: The absolute basics for beginners ([numpy.org](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html))
    *   **Focus on:** What is a NumPy array? How do you create arrays? What is array indexing, slicing, and, most importantly, **vectorization**? This concept is the key to writing fast, modern data science code.
    * For those who are already proficient in NumPy, look up advanced features like universal functions, Numpy strides, and array siblings.
*   **Matplotlib - Our Visualization Tool:**
    * **Tutorial** ([FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4))
    *   **Resource:** Pyplot Tutorial ([matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/pyplot.html))
    *   **Focus on:** How to make a simple `plt.plot()` and `plt.scatter()`. We only need the very basics for now.

* **Probability and Statistics** -  A strong foundation in Probability is essential for RL.
    * **Visuals: ** ([Seeing Theory: Brown University])(https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)
    * **Lecture Slides: ** Check out the following slides from Prof. Rajwade for CS215
        * ([Random Variables](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sI-8arcM2yYnNZ4sHUWIWfBFTLbc-Bpe/edit). 
        * **Focus on: ** Understanding Random Variables, CDF, PDF, LOTUS, Independence, Law of Large Numbers
        * **Ignore for now: ** Moment Generating Functions(MGFs), Chebyshev's inquality, Markov inequality, covariance
    * **Optional: ** Read about the Cental Limit Theorem. 3Blue1Brown's video is an excellent starting point.

#### **Part 2: Assignments**
Assignments have been uploaded in the week 1 directory of this repository. The purpose of these assignments is to ensure a working, practical knowledge of Python and Numpy. For week 1, we'll build games in Python! These same games will be used later on when we train our models to play them. We'll also get started with NumPy and see how vectorization can improve our code speed. 

#### **Part 3: Submission**

Please submit your completed your python code by the end of the week. This will confirm you have your environment set up and are comfortable. After the deadline gets over, the solutions for some of the games the same will be uploaded here.

Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask questions!

### **Week 2: Monte Carlo in Geometry - Vectorization & Integration**

**Objective:** This week we bridge the gap between "coding" and "scientific computing" and understand what Monte Carlo simulations are by getting our hands dirty. You will learn how to use random sampling to solve math problems (calculating areas and integrals) that are hard or impossible to solve analytically. You will also learn the most important rule of Python Data Science: **No For Loops.**

#### **Part 1: Learning Resources**

*   **Monte Carlo Simulation (The Concept):**
    *   **Video:** [Estimating Pi using Monte Carlo Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELetCV_wX_c) (5 mins). A visual introduction to the core concept of this week.
    *   **Article:** [Monte Carlo Integration Explained](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/monte-carlo-methods-in-practice/monte-carlo-integration.html). Skim through to understand how we turn random points into an area estimate.

*   **High Dimensions (The Challenge):**
    *   **Video:** [3Blue1Brown: Thinking about high dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwAD6dRSVyI). This will help you visualize the "Hypersphere" task and understand why grids fail in high dimensions (The Curse of Dimensionality).

**Note:** this week will be more on the practical side, with a longer assignment. You are encouraged to move to the assignment as soon as possible as the theoretical learning resources are scarce. Try to work through as much optional assignment tasks as you can for developing a better understanding of how and where monte carlo mehtods can be used.

#### **Part 2: Assignment**
The assignment `Week2_Geometry_Vectorization.pdf` is uploaded in the Week 2 directory.
*   **Core Tasks:** Estimating $\pi$, Estimating Euler's number ($e$), and comparing Monte Carlo vs. Riemann Sums.
*   **The Iron Rule:** You are **not allowed** to use `for` loops for the calculation logic. You must use NumPy vectorization.
*   **Optional:** Explore the volume of a 10-dimensional hypersphere and see how Monte Carlo beats deterministic methods in high dimensions.

#### **Part 3: Submission**
Submission will be via a Google Form. Make sure your convergence plots are visible in the notebook. Further instructions are available in assignment pdf.

### **Week 3: Getting Started with Reinforcement Learning**
Reinforcement Learning is an exciting field in AI and Machine Learning. It was mainly brought into spotlight by Google's Deep RL agents to play Atari Games in 2013, and then a further public milestone was their AlphaGo model to beat a professional human Go player.

#### **Part 1: Learning Resources**
In this week, we will explore the theoretical foundations of Reinforcement Learning. In any field, a rigorous and thorough understanding is essential before we tackle problems and their algorithmic solutions. The following resources will help you to gain a rigorous understanding of RL.

*   **Textbook:** Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction(Sutton & Barto, 2nd Edition)
      * Read through chapter 1 which covers an introduction to the RL problem
      * Read through chapter 3 for a discussion of Finite Markov Decision Processes, which are needed to formalise the RL problem. 
* **Video Lecture**: David Silver's 2015 Lectures on Reinforcement Learning, DeepMind x UCL. Available on DeepMind's YouTube channel. Watch Lecture 1 and Lecture 2. **Must Watch** through the Student MDP example.
*   **Focus on:** Intuitively understanding what we are trying to solve. Also understand the Bellman Equations. One might say them to be the fundamental equations of RL!

Fun Fact: The word "Dynamic Programming", commonly used in the context of algorithmic design, came from Bellman. He was looking for a unsuspicious word to hide his research from the government. He felt a very positive vibe in the word "Dynamic"!

Another Fun Fact: Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto recieved the 2025 ACM Turing award for their fundamental contributions to Reinforcement Learning.

#### **Part 2: Assignment**
This week's assignment consists of a theoretical problem sheet. It has been uploaded in the week 3 directory of this repository.

#### **Part 3: Submission**
Please submit your answers in pdf format. Both handwritten(provided they are legible) and LaTeX solutions are accepted. A google form will be released for the same. After the deadline gets over, the solutions will be uploaded in the week 3 directory of this repository.
